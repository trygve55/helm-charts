      It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients
      and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically
      upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format
      becomes available. Note that only one type of a given movie is supported. If
      you want both a 4k version and 1080p version of a given movie you will need
      multiple instances.

    description: Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users.
      It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients
      and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically
      upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format
      becomes available. Note that only one type of a given movie is supported. If
      you want both a 4k version and 1080p version of a given movie you will need
      multiple instances.
